Insights: 
  
  Model 1: Criteria(correlation larger than 0.1 or smalled than -0.1), I realized that variables with correlation that is lower than 0.3 or larger than -0.3 didn't have an important impact on the model.

## Understanding Factors that affect accuracy

Notes: 
  English native increased our p value by a lot 
  Gender increased by a little
  Number of classes incrased p value by a lot
